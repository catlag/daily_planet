			Bloody Peasant! How do you know she is a witch? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Bring her forward! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! How do you know she is a witch?
		</p>
		<p>
			Why do you think that she is a witch? Burn her anyway! Well, I didn't vote for you. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. I have to push the pram a lot. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

			Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. How do you know she is a witch? Oh, ow! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

			I am your king. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. But you are dressed as one… Why? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Why do you think that she is a witch?
		</p>

			We want a shrubbery!! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Why? But you are dressed as one…
